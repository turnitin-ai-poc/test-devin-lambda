# [TRA] Lambda Starter Template

This contains a cookiecutter-based starter template for our lambdas. In particular,
it encodes some of our reference architectural patterns around lambdas.

This template can be instantiated for a new project with
```shell
sam init --location /path/to/this/directory
```

TODO: Show how to initialize from GitHub Cloud.

You should not need to checkout this repository, when working with lambdas.

If you want to make changes to the template itself however, then you would want
to checkout this repository, make changes, and create a pull request, following
the [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) instructions.
